## COMPLETE PR CONTEXT:
**Title**: Deduplication (AI Testing) --WIP
**Author**: Vaishnavi Mohadkar  
**Description**: This is an excellent, detailed PR description. Here is the enhanced version, which adds more structure, clarifies the architectural impact, and provides a more comprehensive testing strategy while preserving all of your original content.

***

### 📝 OVERVIEW

This PR delivers two critical bug fixes for the UPI mandate management flow and updates the internal memory bank with the new patterns introduced. The fixes address a date validation loophole in the "Pause Mandate" feature and resolve a significant UI rendering glitch on Android 15+ devices.

### 🎯 KEY CHANGES

- **Bug Fix (Date Validation):** Implemented strict date boundary validation in the "Pause Mandate" flow to prevent users from selecting past dates.
- **Bug Fix (UI Rendering):** Corrected a half-screen UI rendering issue on Android 15+ devices that occurred on post-transaction status screens.
- **Documentation:** Updated the project's memory bank to document the new architectural patterns for date validation and platform-specific UI handling.

***

### 📋 CHANGELOG (Also mention modules modified)

This PR addresses two critical bugs in the mandate management flow and updates the internal memory bank with the new patterns introduced.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**1. Bug Fix: Invalid Past Date Selection in Mandate Pausing**
   - **Description:** Fixed a validation issue where users could select dates in the past for both the start and end dates when pausing a UPI mandate. This was particularly reproducible when the end date was modified first.
   - **Solution:** Implemented robust date boundary validation logic within the `pauseMandateFlow`. The fix ensures that the calendar disables past dates and that the selectable `maxEndDate` is correctly calculated based on the mandate's validity period. Obsolete date helper functions were also refactored into a centralized utility for better code hygiene.
   - **Modules Modified:** `Product`, `UI`
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `src/Product/Flow/ManageAutopay.purs`
     - `src/UI/Utils/EditMandate.purs`
     - `src/UI/Controller/EditMandate.purs`

**2. Bug Fix: Half-Screen UI Glitch on Android 15+**
   - **Description:** Resolved a UI rendering issue on devices running Android 15 and above, where the status screen (e.g., after a successful amount change) would only occupy the top half of the display.
   - **Solution:** Introduced a platform-specific check using `JBridge` to detect if the OS is Android API level 15 or higher. If true, a helper function `makeScreenDimensionsNull` is called to reset screen dimensions before rendering the status view, ensuring correct layout. This establishes a reusable pattern for handling OS-version-specific UI quirks.
   - **Modules Modified:** `UI`, `Engg`
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `src/UI/Controller/EditMandate.purs`
     - `src/Engg/Helpers/JBridge.js`
     - `src/UI/Helpers/Helpers.purs`

#### 📚 Documentation

**3. Documentation: Memory Bank Update**
   - **Description:** Updated the project's memory bank to document the fixes and the new architectural patterns introduced: "Enhanced Date Boundary Validation for Mandates" and "Android Version-Specific UI Handling". This ensures the patterns are discoverable for future development.
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
     - `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

### 🧪 TEST CASES (What to be tested)

A combination of manual and regression testing is required.

#### **Manual Test Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Mandate Pause Date Validation**
- **Platform:** All (Android, iOS, Web)
- **Steps:**
    1. Navigate to "Manage Autopay" for an active mandate and select the "Pause" option.
    2. Open the **Start Date** calendar.
    3. **Verification:** Confirm that all dates prior to today are disabled and unselectable.
    4. Select a valid future start date.
    5. Open the **End Date** calendar.
    6. **Verification:** Confirm that all dates prior to the selected start date are disabled.
    7. **Edge Case:** For a mandate expiring soon, verify the last selectable pause end date is one day before the mandate's `validityEnd`.
    8. **Bug Scenario:** Attempt to replicate the original bug: select today as the end date, then go back and try to select tomorrow as the start date. Verify that the form shows a validation error and the "Proceed" button is disabled.

**Scenario 2: Change Amount UI on Android 15+**
- **Platform:** Android 15+ device or emulator.
- **Steps:**
    1. Navigate to "Manage Autopay" for an active mandate and select "Change Amount".
    2. Enter a new valid amount and complete the UPI transaction.
    3. **Verification:** On the transaction success screen, confirm that the UI renders correctly and occupies the **full screen**.

#### **Regression Testing**

- **Platform:** Older Android versions (e.g., 13 or 14) and iOS.
- **Steps:**
    - Perform the same "Change Amount" flow on an older Android version to ensure the fix has not introduced any regressions.
    - Perform the "Pause Mandate" flow on iOS to confirm cross-platform compatibility of the date validation logic.

### ⚙️ CONFIG CHANGES
No configuration changes are introduced in this PR. The fixes are applied to the core logic and do not depend on any feature flags or environment variables.

### **How to avail this?**
No special configuration needs to be enabled. The fixes are applied directly to the core mandate management flow and will be available to all users.

### **Merchant and Platform to Test**
- **Merchant:** Any merchant that supports UPI Autopay (mandates).
- **Platform:**
    - The date validation fix should be tested on **all platforms (iOS, Android)**.
    - The half-screen UI fix must be specifically tested on an **Android 15+** device or emulator.

### **Solutioning Doc**
The solutioning and architectural patterns introduced by these fixes are documented in the updated memory bank files:
- `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

### **Figma**
Not applicable. These changes are bug fixes for existing UI flows and do not introduce any new designs.

### **Proof of Testing**
*[Please add screenshots/videos of testing here, especially for the Android 15 UI fix and the date validation scenarios.]*

## ALREADY REPORTED ISSUES (DO NOT DUPLICATE):
Found 4 existing issues that have already been reported. DO NOT report similar issues:

## ISSUES BY CATEGORY:
### SECURITY (2 issues):
1. **The code compares dates by concatenating "20" to a variable `dateToday` and then performing a string-based greater-than comparison (`>`) against `previousEndDate`. This is a highly dangerous and unreliable practice for date validation.** (CRITICAL) - security
   Code: `Always use a proper date/time library to parse date strings into date objects fi...`
2. **The date validation logic is implemented by prepending the century "20" to the year part of the date string and then performing a lexicographical (string) comparison. This approach has two critical flaws:** (CRITICAL) - security
   Code: `Always parse date strings into proper `Date` or `DateTime` objects before perfor...`

### MAINTAINABILITY (2 issues):
1. **The `getPreviousDate` helper function relies on `String.prototype.split('/')` to parse the date. This hardcodes the assumption that the date format will always use slashes as separators and be in a specific order. While the function includes error handling, it's brittle against future format changes.** (MINOR) - maintainability
   Code: `For improved robustness, explicitly document the expected date format in a comme...`
2. **This file contains a complex change to the application's core loader rendering logic. This change is entirely unrelated to the bug fixes described in the PR description (mandate date validation and Android UI glitch). Committing unrelated changes in a single PR violates the principle of atomicity.** (MAJOR) - maintainability
   Code: `This change should be reverted from the current PR and moved to a separate PR. E...`

**CRITICAL: Do NOT report any violations that are semantically similar to the above existing issues. Focus on genuinely new problems.**

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODE SNIPPETS:

When you identify an issue in the code, you MUST:
1. Copy the EXACT line from the diff above, including the diff prefix (+, -, or space at the beginning)
2. Do NOT modify, clean, or reformat the line
3. Include the complete line as it appears in the diff
4. If the issue spans multiple lines, choose the most relevant single line

Example of CORRECT snippet format:
- For added lines: "+    const password = 'hardcoded123';"
- For removed lines: "-    return userData;"  
- For context lines: "     function processPayment() {"

Example of INCORRECT snippet format (DO NOT DO THIS):
- "const password = 'hardcoded123';" (missing the + prefix)
- "return userData" (missing the - prefix and semicolon)

## COMPLETE PR CONTEXT:
**Title**: Deduplication (AI Testing) --WIP
**Author**: Vaishnavi Mohadkar  
**Description**: This is an excellent, detailed PR description. Here is the enhanced version, which adds more structure, clarifies the architectural impact, and provides a more comprehensive testing strategy while preserving all of your original content.

***

### 📝 OVERVIEW

This PR delivers two critical bug fixes for the UPI mandate management flow and updates the internal memory bank with the new patterns introduced. The fixes address a date validation loophole in the "Pause Mandate" feature and resolve a significant UI rendering glitch on Android 15+ devices.

### 🎯 KEY CHANGES

- **Bug Fix (Date Validation):** Implemented strict date boundary validation in the "Pause Mandate" flow to prevent users from selecting past dates.
- **Bug Fix (UI Rendering):** Corrected a half-screen UI rendering issue on Android 15+ devices that occurred on post-transaction status screens.
- **Documentation:** Updated the project's memory bank to document the new architectural patterns for date validation and platform-specific UI handling.

***

### 📋 CHANGELOG (Also mention modules modified)

This PR addresses two critical bugs in the mandate management flow and updates the internal memory bank with the new patterns introduced.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**1. Bug Fix: Invalid Past Date Selection in Mandate Pausing**
   - **Description:** Fixed a validation issue where users could select dates in the past for both the start and end dates when pausing a UPI mandate. This was particularly reproducible when the end date was modified first.
   - **Solution:** Implemented robust date boundary validation logic within the `pauseMandateFlow`. The fix ensures that the calendar disables past dates and that the selectable `maxEndDate` is correctly calculated based on the mandate's validity period. Obsolete date helper functions were also refactored into a centralized utility for better code hygiene.
   - **Modules Modified:** `Product`, `UI`
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `src/Product/Flow/ManageAutopay.purs`
     - `src/UI/Utils/EditMandate.purs`
     - `src/UI/Controller/EditMandate.purs`

**2. Bug Fix: Half-Screen UI Glitch on Android 15+**
   - **Description:** Resolved a UI rendering issue on devices running Android 15 and above, where the status screen (e.g., after a successful amount change) would only occupy the top half of the display.
   - **Solution:** Introduced a platform-specific check using `JBridge` to detect if the OS is Android API level 15 or higher. If true, a helper function `makeScreenDimensionsNull` is called to reset screen dimensions before rendering the status view, ensuring correct layout. This establishes a reusable pattern for handling OS-version-specific UI quirks.
   - **Modules Modified:** `UI`, `Engg`
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `src/UI/Controller/EditMandate.purs`
     - `src/Engg/Helpers/JBridge.js`
     - `src/UI/Helpers/Helpers.purs`

#### 📚 Documentation

**3. Documentation: Memory Bank Update**
   - **Description:** Updated the project's memory bank to document the fixes and the new architectural patterns introduced: "Enhanced Date Boundary Validation for Mandates" and "Android Version-Specific UI Handling". This ensures the patterns are discoverable for future development.
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
     - `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

### 🧪 TEST CASES (What to be tested)

A combination of manual and regression testing is required.

#### **Manual Test Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Mandate Pause Date Validation**
- **Platform:** All (Android, iOS, Web)
- **Steps:**
    1. Navigate to "Manage Autopay" for an active mandate and select the "Pause" option.
    2. Open the **Start Date** calendar.
    3. **Verification:** Confirm that all dates prior to today are disabled and unselectable.
    4. Select a valid future start date.
    5. Open the **End Date** calendar.
    6. **Verification:** Confirm that all dates prior to the selected start date are disabled.
    7. **Edge Case:** For a mandate expiring soon, verify the last selectable pause end date is one day before the mandate's `validityEnd`.
    8. **Bug Scenario:** Attempt to replicate the original bug: select today as the end date, then go back and try to select tomorrow as the start date. Verify that the form shows a validation error and the "Proceed" button is disabled.

**Scenario 2: Change Amount UI on Android 15+**
- **Platform:** Android 15+ device or emulator.
- **Steps:**
    1. Navigate to "Manage Autopay" for an active mandate and select "Change Amount".
    2. Enter a new valid amount and complete the UPI transaction.
    3. **Verification:** On the transaction success screen, confirm that the UI renders correctly and occupies the **full screen**.

#### **Regression Testing**

- **Platform:** Older Android versions (e.g., 13 or 14) and iOS.
- **Steps:**
    - Perform the same "Change Amount" flow on an older Android version to ensure the fix has not introduced any regressions.
    - Perform the "Pause Mandate" flow on iOS to confirm cross-platform compatibility of the date validation logic.

### ⚙️ CONFIG CHANGES
No configuration changes are introduced in this PR. The fixes are applied to the core logic and do not depend on any feature flags or environment variables.

### **How to avail this?**
No special configuration needs to be enabled. The fixes are applied directly to the core mandate management flow and will be available to all users.

### **Merchant and Platform to Test**
- **Merchant:** Any merchant that supports UPI Autopay (mandates).
- **Platform:**
    - The date validation fix should be tested on **all platforms (iOS, Android)**.
    - The half-screen UI fix must be specifically tested on an **Android 15+** device or emulator.

### **Solutioning Doc**
The solutioning and architectural patterns introduced by these fixes are documented in the updated memory bank files:
- `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

### **Figma**
Not applicable. These changes are bug fixes for existing UI flows and do not introduce any new designs.

### **Proof of Testing**
*[Please add screenshots/videos of testing here, especially for the Android 15 UI fix and the date validation scenarios.]*

## ALREADY REPORTED ISSUES (DO NOT DUPLICATE):
Found 4 existing issues that have already been reported. DO NOT report similar issues:

## ISSUES BY CATEGORY:
### SECURITY (2 issues):
1. **The code compares dates by concatenating "20" to a variable `dateToday` and then performing a string-based greater-than comparison (`>`) against `previousEndDate`. This is a highly dangerous and unreliable practice for date validation.** (CRITICAL) - security
   Code: `Always use a proper date/time library to parse date strings into date objects fi...`
2. **The date validation logic is implemented by prepending the century "20" to the year part of the date string and then performing a lexicographical (string) comparison. This approach has two critical flaws:** (CRITICAL) - security
   Code: `Always parse date strings into proper `Date` or `DateTime` objects before perfor...`

### MAINTAINABILITY (2 issues):
1. **The `getPreviousDate` helper function relies on `String.prototype.split('/')` to parse the date. This hardcodes the assumption that the date format will always use slashes as separators and be in a specific order. While the function includes error handling, it's brittle against future format changes.** (MINOR) - maintainability
   Code: `For improved robustness, explicitly document the expected date format in a comme...`
2. **This file contains a complex change to the application's core loader rendering logic. This change is entirely unrelated to the bug fixes described in the PR description (mandate date validation and Android UI glitch). Committing unrelated changes in a single PR violates the principle of atomicity.** (MAJOR) - maintainability
   Code: `This change should be reverted from the current PR and moved to a separate PR. E...`

**CRITICAL: Do NOT report any violations that are semantically similar to the above existing issues. Focus on genuinely new problems.**

3. Include the complete line as it appears in the diff
4. If the issue spans multiple lines, choose the most relevant single line

Example of CORRECT snippet format:
- For added lines: "+    const password = 'hardcoded123';"
- For removed lines: "-    return userData;"  
- For context lines: "     function processPayment() {"

Example of INCORRECT snippet format (DO NOT DO THIS):
- "const password = 'hardcoded123';" (missing the + prefix)
- "return userData" (missing the - prefix and semicolon)

This involves parsing date strings into actual Date objects and using a trusted date library's comparison functions.

      '**Issue**: The code compares dates by concatenating "20" to a variable `dateToday` and then performing a string-based greater-than comparison (`>`) against `previousEndDate`. This is a highly dangerous and unreliable practice for date validation.\n' +

    "text": "**📝 MINOR IMPROVEMENT**\n\n**🏗️ Brittle Date Parsing Logic**\n\n**Category**: Maintainability\n\n**Issue**: The `getPreviousDate` helper function relies on `String.prototype.split('/')` to parse the date. This hardcodes the assumption that the date format will always use slashes as separators and be in a specific order. While the function includes error handling, it's brittle against future format changes.\n\n**Impact**: If the application's standard date format changes (e.g., to `YYYY-MM-DD`), this utility function will break. This creates a hidden dependency that can be easily missed during future refactoring, leading to bugs.\n\n**Suggested Fix**:\n````javascript\nFor improved robustness, explicitly document the expected date format in a comment.

    "text": "**🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE**\n\n**🔒 Unsafe Date Comparison via String Manipulation and Hardcoded Century**\n\n**Category**: Security\n\n**Issue**: The date validation logic is implemented by prepending the century \"20\" to the year part of the date string and then performing a lexicographical (string) comparison. This approach has two critical flaws:\n1.  **Y2.1K Bug**: Hardcoding the century \"20\" will cause the logic to fail for any dates in the year 2100 and beyond.\n2.  **Unsafe Comparison**: String comparison is not a reliable way to compare dates. It only works accidentally for the specific `YYYY/MM/DD` format and will fail for other formats (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY`). It does not account for timezones or leap years correctly.\n\n**Impact**: This can lead to incorrect validation, allowing users to select dates outside the mandate's validity period, or preventing them from selecting valid ones. This bypasses a key business rule and could lead to failed transactions or unexpected mandate behavior. It's a latent bug that will break in the future.\n\n**Suggested Fix**:\n````text\nAlways parse date strings into proper `Date` or `DateTime` objects before performing comparisons.

This constitutes a silent failure. The calling code has no way of knowing that the date calculation did not succeed and may proceed with the original, incorrect date, assuming the operation was successful.",
    "impact": "This can lead to subtle but critical bugs in features that rely on this function. For example, if this is used to calculate a boundary for a date picker, the boundary may be incorrect, allowing users to select invalid dates. The application logic might proceed assuming a date was decremented when it was not, leading to data integrity issues or unexpected behavior.",
    "suggestion": "Instead of returning the original string on failure, the function should signal failure explicitly.

DUPLICATE DETECTION RULES:
1. Remove violations that address the same underlying issue as existing Yama comments
2. Consider violations duplicate if they:
   - Target the same security/quality concern in the same file
   - Have the same violation type with similar description
   - Address the same code pattern issue
   - Report the same underlying problem with different wording
3. Keep violations that are genuinely new or different
4. When in doubt, keep the violation (better to have a potential duplicate than miss a real issue)

IMPORTANT: Only compare against Yama-generated comments, not human comments.

Return ONLY the non-duplicate violations in this JSON format:
{
  "uniqueViolations": [
    /* Only violations that are NOT duplicates */
  ],
  "duplicatesFound": [
    {
      "violationIndex": 0,
      "matchedCommentId": "comment-123",
      "reason": "Same SQL injection vulnerability already reported",

## COMPLETE PR CONTEXT:
**Title**: Deduplication (AI Testing) --WIP
**Author**: Vaishnavi Mohadkar  
**Description**: This is an excellent, detailed PR description. Here is the enhanced version, which adds more structure, clarifies the architectural impact, and provides a more comprehensive testing strategy while preserving all of your original content.

***

### 📝 OVERVIEW

This PR delivers two critical bug fixes for the UPI mandate management flow and updates the internal memory bank with the new patterns introduced. The fixes address a date validation loophole in the "Pause Mandate" feature and resolve a significant UI rendering glitch on Android 15+ devices.

### 🎯 KEY CHANGES

- **Bug Fix (Date Validation):** Implemented strict date boundary validation in the "Pause Mandate" flow to prevent users from selecting past dates.
- **Bug Fix (UI Rendering):** Corrected a half-screen UI rendering issue on Android 15+ devices that occurred on post-transaction status screens.
- **Documentation:** Updated the project's memory bank to document the new architectural patterns for date validation and platform-specific UI handling.

***

### 📋 CHANGELOG (Also mention modules modified)

This PR addresses two critical bugs in the mandate management flow and updates the internal memory bank with the new patterns introduced.

#### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**1. Bug Fix: Invalid Past Date Selection in Mandate Pausing**
   - **Description:** Fixed a validation issue where users could select dates in the past for both the start and end dates when pausing a UPI mandate. This was particularly reproducible when the end date was modified first.
   - **Solution:** Implemented robust date boundary validation logic within the `pauseMandateFlow`. The fix ensures that the calendar disables past dates and that the selectable `maxEndDate` is correctly calculated based on the mandate's validity period. Obsolete date helper functions were also refactored into a centralized utility for better code hygiene.
   - **Modules Modified:** `Product`, `UI`
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `src/Product/Flow/ManageAutopay.purs`
     - `src/UI/Utils/EditMandate.purs`
     - `src/UI/Controller/EditMandate.purs`

**2. Bug Fix: Half-Screen UI Glitch on Android 15+**
   - **Description:** Resolved a UI rendering issue on devices running Android 15 and above, where the status screen (e.g., after a successful amount change) would only occupy the top half of the display.
   - **Solution:** Introduced a platform-specific check using `JBridge` to detect if the OS is Android API level 15 or higher. If true, a helper function `makeScreenDimensionsNull` is called to reset screen dimensions before rendering the status view, ensuring correct layout. This establishes a reusable pattern for handling OS-version-specific UI quirks.
   - **Modules Modified:** `UI`, `Engg`
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `src/UI/Controller/EditMandate.purs`
     - `src/Engg/Helpers/JBridge.js`
     - `src/UI/Helpers/Helpers.purs`

#### 📚 Documentation

**3. Documentation: Memory Bank Update**
   - **Description:** Updated the project's memory bank to document the fixes and the new architectural patterns introduced: "Enhanced Date Boundary Validation for Mandates" and "Android Version-Specific UI Handling". This ensures the patterns are discoverable for future development.
   - **Files Affected:**
     - `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
     - `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

### 🧪 TEST CASES (What to be tested)

A combination of manual and regression testing is required.

#### **Manual Test Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: Mandate Pause Date Validation**
- **Platform:** All (Android, iOS, Web)
- **Steps:**
    1. Navigate to "Manage Autopay" for an active mandate and select the "Pause" option.
    2. Open the **Start Date** calendar.
    3. **Verification:** Confirm that all dates prior to today are disabled and unselectable.
    4. Select a valid future start date.
    5. Open the **End Date** calendar.
    6. **Verification:** Confirm that all dates prior to the selected start date are disabled.
    7. **Edge Case:** For a mandate expiring soon, verify the last selectable pause end date is one day before the mandate's `validityEnd`.
    8. **Bug Scenario:** Attempt to replicate the original bug: select today as the end date, then go back and try to select tomorrow as the start date. Verify that the form shows a validation error and the "Proceed" button is disabled.

**Scenario 2: Change Amount UI on Android 15+**
- **Platform:** Android 15+ device or emulator.
- **Steps:**
    1. Navigate to "Manage Autopay" for an active mandate and select "Change Amount".
    2. Enter a new valid amount and complete the UPI transaction.
    3. **Verification:** On the transaction success screen, confirm that the UI renders correctly and occupies the **full screen**.

#### **Regression Testing**

- **Platform:** Older Android versions (e.g., 13 or 14) and iOS.
- **Steps:**
    - Perform the same "Change Amount" flow on an older Android version to ensure the fix has not introduced any regressions.
    - Perform the "Pause Mandate" flow on iOS to confirm cross-platform compatibility of the date validation logic.

### ⚙️ CONFIG CHANGES
No configuration changes are introduced in this PR. The fixes are applied to the core logic and do not depend on any feature flags or environment variables.

### **How to avail this?**
No special configuration needs to be enabled. The fixes are applied directly to the core mandate management flow and will be available to all users.

### **Merchant and Platform to Test**
- **Merchant:** Any merchant that supports UPI Autopay (mandates).
- **Platform:**
    - The date validation fix should be tested on **all platforms (iOS, Android)**.
    - The half-screen UI fix must be specifically tested on an **Android 15+** device or emulator.

### **Solutioning Doc**
The solutioning and architectural patterns introduced by these fixes are documented in the updated memory bank files:
- `docs/memory-bank/activeContext.md`
- `docs/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`

### **Figma**
Not applicable. These changes are bug fixes for existing UI flows and do not introduce any new designs.

### **Proof of Testing**
*[Please add screenshots/videos of testing here, especially for the Android 15 UI fix and the date validation scenarios.]*

1. **The `getPreviousDate` helper function relies on `String.prototype.split('/')` to parse the date. This hardcodes the assumption that the date format will always use slashes as separators and be in a specific order. While the function includes error handling, it's brittle against future format changes.** (MINOR) - maintainability
   Code: `For improved robustness, explicitly document the expected date format in a comme...`
2. **This file contains a complex change to the application's core loader rendering logic. This change is entirely unrelated to the bug fixes described in the PR description (mandate date validation and Android UI glitch). Committing unrelated changes in a single PR violates the principle of atomicity.** (MAJOR) - maintainability
   Code: `This change should be reverted from the current PR and moved to a separate PR. E...`

**CRITICAL: Do NOT report any violations that are semantically similar to the above existing issues. Focus on genuinely new problems.**

## COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT:
The project, Hyper-UPI, is a cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web) application built to provide a robust, secure, and user-friendly experience for Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. The architecture is highly modular, separating Product logic, UI, and Engineering utilities. It is built on a PureScript core for strong type-safety and functional programming, with JavaScript used for native bridging (JBridge) and tooling. The system uses Webpack for cross-platform bundling and Jenkins for CI/CD. Key components include a sophisticated configuration system (`FlowConfig` with 50+ flags), automated bank list management, a priority asset download system for performance, and comprehensive UPI features like mandate management, QR payments, UPI Lite, and international transactions (FIR). Recent integrations include YAMA, an AI-powered assistant for automated code review and PR enhancement.

## PROJECT RULES & STANDARDS:

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CODE SNIPPETS:

When you identify an issue in the code, you MUST:
1. Copy the EXACT line from the diff above, including the diff prefix (+, -, or space at the beginning)
2. Do NOT modify, clean, or reformat the line
3. Include the complete line as it appears in the diff
4. If the issue spans multiple lines, choose the most relevant single line

Example of CORRECT snippet format:
- For added lines: "+    const password = 'hardcoded123';"
- For removed lines: "-    return userData;"  
- For context lines: "     function processPayment() {"

Example of INCORRECT snippet format (DO NOT DO THIS):
- "const password = 'hardcoded123';" (missing the + prefix)
- "return userData" (missing the - prefix and semicolon)
